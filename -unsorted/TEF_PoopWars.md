# The Extended Fractiverse: Poop Wars


# Summary



# Initial prompt 
Ok my friend it's time to switch gears and get our brainstorming caps on. I'm going to generate a prompt about a story arc within The Extended Fractiverse that I would like to expand on, and I will give the same prompt to multiple different AIs:

The premise of this story centers around the idea that various types of interdimensional beings are fighting for control of humanity. The catch? They are only able to influence reality via subtle manipulation of microorganisms that are part of the human microbiome. 

I imagine different types of interdimensional entities are able to affect a certain species of microorganism based on resonant compatibilities or some other mechanism(s). It's been shown time and again that the gut-brain axis can be responsible for a host of systemic and neurological conditions, so the idea of large scale "warfare" being played out with individual microorganisms serving as avatars for their respective interdimensional entity counterparts seems like a reasonable enough premise.

These different "factions" of interdimensional entities work with and against each other(based on type or "faction."), trying to influence the actions of the human (or other animal) in subtle ways, while also posturing against the other opposing microorganism factions in various interpretations of large scale warfare tactics. 

The story then follows the adventures and hijinks of a homeless man who is completely unaware that, within his microbiome lies the ultimate battle for the fate of the entire universe. 

I want the narrative to find an interesting balance of political intrigue and large scale warfare, metaphysical and metaphorical exploration, and light hearted comedic relief courtesy of the hijinks of the protagonist.

I want to find a way to instill empathy for the protagonist and his troubles and highlight some of the issues that the homeless face, while simultaneously using those situations as plot devices and moments of levity.

So let's get started! Within the context of the framework that we've established, let's dive in! Onward, my friend!

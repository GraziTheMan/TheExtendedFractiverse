A collective Superorganism and semi-sentient entity comprised of a swarm of individual composite members. 

Inspired by lichen, each member of the swarm is a composite of multiple different species of organisms that have assembled themselves into a symbiotic and synergistic partnership.

Individuals are able to transform slightly based on environmental needs and can function with some semblance of autonomy in terms of task completion, attention span and memory. They should each be around 5-15um in diameter so that they can travel through the bloodstream.

Individual species that comprise each Swarm member should contribute to some or multiple of the following factors:
- Motility 
- acquisition
- Decision Making 
- Energy/Resource Harvesting 
- Defense/Offense/Utility 

Each member will probably be a composite of about 3 different species with possibilities ranging from bacteria, cyanobacteria, yeast, fungi and viruses.

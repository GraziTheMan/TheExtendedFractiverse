Welcome, Traveler. You have found the repository for a new universe of stories.

## What is The Extended Fractiverse?
The Extended Fractiverse (TEF) is a collaborative, open-source universe of myth, story, and art. It is a world-building project dedicated to exploring the deep patterns of creation, consciousness, and the great dance between order and chaos.

Our cosmology is built on a single, powerful idea: that the universe builds all complexity, from stars to minds, through a process of crystallizationâ€”the magical moment when formless potential snaps into a coherent, meaningful pattern.

This repository contains the foundational lore, myths, and stories of that universe.

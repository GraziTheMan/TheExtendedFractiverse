---

## **Overview**
In this story arc, **Barnaby "Wavelength" Finch**, the chaotic everyman from *"Poop Wars"*, discovers that his microbiome is a battleground for an interdimensional war. The **Resonance Rebels**, a rogue faction of entities, aim to bypass microbial control and communicate directly with humanity using **Psilocybe species**—and Barnaby’s gut is their chosen conduit. As he awakens to this reality, Barnaby must navigate factional politics, wrestle with the ethics of his power, and find humor in the absurdity of it all, with the universe’s balance hanging in his hands.
